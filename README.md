## User Testing

### Issue 1 - Title Hyperlink

While conducting the user testing, one issue was identified which was to do with the site navigation for the attraction section. I did notice that several users clicked on the title of the places assuming it might link them to selected page. Hence, taking this in account, the title was hyper linked to that specific page.

## Further Work

The simple weather js was one of the feature that was supposed to be implemented into the website to display current weather for the location. Unfortunately, due to some error it had to be dropped down and may be reconsidered in the future.

## Conclusion

The front-end web development module has been one of the most enjoyable module for me throughout the year.  It has been interesting to learn about new web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript’s frameworks.  Also, it’s quite positive to known about current techniques used in today’s websites mainly responsive web design and mobile first approach which I had little or no knowledge about which will be useful for future web development.

Special thanks to Dave and Fania for putting their efforts towards making this module both exciting and gratifying.
