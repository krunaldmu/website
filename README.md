## User Testing

While conducting the user testing, one issue was identified which was to do with the site navigation for the attraction section. I did notice that several users clicked on the title of the places assuming it might link them to selected page. Hence, taking this in account, the title was hyper linked to that specific page.

Another issue identified during the testing was the navigation bar for the website was missing the hamburger menu for tablet and mobile devices webpage. As a result, the overall navigation bar was redesigned from scratch to implement the feature.
